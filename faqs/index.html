    <div class="question-container">
        <div class="question">Why did you build this thing?</div>
        <div class="answer">Because my laboratory could not afford the commercial equivalent, and because looking for crystals in hundreds of wells is a drag - particularly in the coldroom!</div>
    </div>
    <div class="question-container">
        <div class="question">How much did it cost?</div>
        <div class="answer">The device shown on the home page cost about $500.  This includes the translation stage, camera, microscope optics, microscope stand, keyboard, mouse, monitor, and the control computer.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="question-container">
        <div class="question">How much time does it take to build one?</div>
        <div class="answer">Once you have gathered/printed all the parts, about a day.  However, some of the 3D printed parts take hours to print.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="question-container">
        <div class="question">What tools do I need?</div>
        <div class="answer">Screwdrivers, allen keys, a soldering iron (for the limit switches), and a drill press and table saw (for the X-base and Y-base pieces and the adjustable sample holder).</div>
    </div>
    <div class="question-container">
        <div class="question">How much skill is required?</div>
        <div class="answer">Not too much, but you need to do a careful job.  Small misalignments due to imprecise assembly will be handled by the software, but you need to ensure that all of the parts move smoothly.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="question-container">
        <div class="question">Do you sell assembled machines and/or specialized parts needed to build one?</div>
        <div class="answer">I’m not looking to give up my day job, but, if there’s sufficient interest to justify hiring help, I will consider selling parts and possibly assembled devices. In other words, let me know if you’re interested.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="question-container">
        <div class="question">Do you foresee improvements to the system?</div>
        <div class="answer">Yes, see <a href="{{ '/future' | relative_url }}">future plans</a>.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="question-container">
        <div class="question">I'd like to help. How can I contribute to this project?</div>
        <div class="answer">
            <p>If you build one, share your experience. If you make software or hardware improvements, share those as well. Also, I’d be more than happy for help managing this site.</p>
