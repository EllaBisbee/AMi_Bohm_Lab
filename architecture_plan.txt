general architecture plan:

init:
-read in data from configuration file and store it for future use
-initialize the GUI and display it

microscope:
-object that contains all necessary information about the system
-contains:
  -corner positions
  -number of wells per position
  -z offset (for taking photos)
  -number of photos (for taking photos)
  -zoom (current zoom amount)
  -current position
  -sample ID (substance identifier)
  -plate ID 
  -height/width of plate in "wells"
  
 read/write config:
 -read and write configuration file, mostly used to update
 current configuration file (e.g. corner position)
 
 GUI:
 -series of button callback functions for completing tasks and 
 updating system information
 -see picture for what buttons are included in GUI (for now)
