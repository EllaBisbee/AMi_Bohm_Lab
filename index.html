            <p>This site describes the construction and use of an 
                inexpensive, automated microscope system for 
                imaging samples in multi-well plates.  A paper 
                describing the original system is <a href="https://doi.org/10.1107/S2053230X18016515">here</a>, and one 
                describing a less expensive, more stable device 
                that includes a dedicated graphical user interface 
                is <a href="http://scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/paper?ft5102">here</a>. Updates to the design and software will be 
                posted to this site as they become available. </p>
            <p>Please see the <a href="/faqs.html">FAQs</a> before writing me with questions.</p>
            <p>We normally use this system to search for protein 
                crystals in 96 well plates, but it can easily be 
                programmed to image samples in 12 or 24 well plates 
                as well. Plates with more than one sample at each 
                row/column index are also supported. The 
                computer-controlled stage yields reproducible 3D
                movements of 160 mm in x, 100 mm in y, and 40mm in z. 
                To highlight what else is possible, here are a few 
                images of some non-crystalline <a href="/other_samples.html">samples</a>.</p>

            <p>The 3D translation stage is built from the light-duty CNC machine (~$135) shown on the right. The original machine allowed computer-controlled translation of the rotary cutting tool in X and Z, and translation of the object being cut along Y.</p>
            <p>To convert the CNC machine to a 3D microscope stage, you’ll need to rearrange the parts, add some new, 3D printed parts, and screw the whole thing to stable base. You will also need to add a sample holder in place of the cutting tool, securely mount a microscope and camera, and connect the camera such that images can be triggered by the arduino-based board that drives the CNC machine. Construction requires a small amount of soldering, and some of the parts that hold the microscope and sample holder are 3D printed. You will also need access to a table saw and drill press.</p>
            <p>The <a href="{{ 'assets/documents/hardware.pdf' | relative_url }}">DETAILS</a> page provides much more information.</p>
            <p>Plans for the 3D printed parts are <a href="{{ 'assets/misc/parts.tar' | relative_url }}">HERE</a>.</p>

            <p>As shown on the right, it is possible to use the AMi translation stage with an existing microscope. To fully integrate the system, you’ll need to mount the picamera (an inexpensive board-based sensor chip) in place of the camera shown. 3D printing files for a C-mount adapter that will couple many microscopes to the picamera can be found with the other plans below.</p>
            <p>Be careful. Some microscopes may tip in this configuration! Also, any movement between the microscope and the stage will necessitate recalibration. The calibration procedure is described in the details link below If you’re using existing optics, my recommendation is that you mount the microscope pole to the base of the translation stage rather than have is physically separated as in the photo.</p>
