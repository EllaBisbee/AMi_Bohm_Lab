            <p>This site describes the construction and use of an 
                inexpensive, automated microscope system for 
                imaging samples in multi-well plates.  A paper 
                describing the original system is <a href="https://doi.org/10.1107/S2053230X18016515">here</a>, and one 
                describing a less expensive, more stable device 
                that includes a dedicated graphical user interface 
                is <a href="http://scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/paper?ft5102">here</a>. Updates to the design and software will be 
                posted to this site as they become available. </p>
            <p>Please see the <a href="/faqs.html">FAQs</a> before writing me with questions.</p>
            <p>We normally use this system to search for protein 
                crystals in 96 well plates, but it can easily be 
                programmed to image samples in 12 or 24 well plates 
                as well. Plates with more than one sample at each 
                row/column index are also supported. The 
                computer-controlled stage yields reproducible 3D m
                ovements of 160 mm in x, 100 mm in y, and 40mm in z. 
                To highlight what else is possible, here are a few 
                images of some non-crystalline <a href="/other_samples.html">samples</a>.</p>
