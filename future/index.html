</div>

<div class="container py-3">
    <h2 class="h2">In the shortish run:</h2>
    <ul class="list-group">
        <li class="list-group-item">Create an information management system that helps organize the images from multiple plates and allows users to see how a plate that has been scanned multiple times changes over time.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">Build an inverted version of the microscope. (This might also be more useful for those imaging cells.)</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">Implement fluorescence imaging for crystals that have been labeled with trace amounts of fluorophore a la Pusey et al., 2015.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="container py-3">
    <h2 class="h2">In the longer run:</h2>
    <ul class="list-group">
        <li class="list-group-item">Build a small hotel and associated software.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">Implement automated alignment and focusing via sensors and image processing.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">Implement an automated crystal identification system. Significant work along these lines has already been done by others, but the results were mixed when I tried to implement them on the z-stacked images I collected of crystallization drops containing small, poorly formed crystals.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="container py-3">
    <h2 class="h2">General design goals:</h2>
    <ul class="list-group">
        <li class="list-group-item">Keep the improvements in the public domain.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">Keep the cost of the device relatively low.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">Limit the use of proprietary software.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">Make the assembly and use as simple as possible.</li>
    </ul>
